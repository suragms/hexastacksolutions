HexaStack retains ownership of internal foundational boilerplates, proprietary components, and libraries.

                                    HexaStack Solutions strives for 99.9% uptime for cloud deployments. However, the systems are provided "as-is", and scheduled maintenance or emergency security patching may result in strictly monitored, minimal downtime. We will not be liable for revenue losses attributed directly to infrastructure interruptions unless enforced via a discrete enterprise SLA (Service Level Agreement).

                                    All invoices for consulting phases, development milestones, and SaaS subscriptions are due effectively upon receipt or as structured in the formal Statement of Work (SOW). HexaStack reserves the right to suspend platform access, API connections, and database read/write queries instantly if account balances remain perpetually past due.

                                    Due to the immediate access to digital infrastructure and intellectual property granted upon purchase, all sales of Software-as-a-Service subscriptions (including HexaBill), digital modules, and pre-built platforms are strictly <strong>non-refundable and non-returnable</strong> under any circumstances. We highly encourage clients to thoroughly evaluate demonstrations or trial periods prior to executing a final purchase.

                                    Payments made for custom development milestones, deployment phases, or hourly technical consulting are compensating labor output and are inherently <strong>non-refundable</strong>. If a project is terminated prematurely by the client, they forfeit access to any incomplete source code unless previously cleared invoices cover specific feature deliverables.
